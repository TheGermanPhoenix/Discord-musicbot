# Discord-musicbot
This is a simple Musicbot, which runs for docker and is able to control multiple Instances(DiscordBots), so you can use one command to control multiple MusicBots(multiple voice channel).
config.json needs your token for bot and every entry in this list representates one discordbot which can be used in here.
